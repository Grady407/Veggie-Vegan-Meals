      This site has been brought to you by 'The Blinking Code Cursor'!
      <br/>
      In my efforts to facilitate healthy eating, I've used many hours of my life trying to code this site to the best of my current ability.
      I've experienced many health benefits from eating healthy. Some of which includes a promotion at work, multiplie likes on instagram, and I've even started jogging again.
      <br/>
      But honestly, even though I'm not consistent with my healty diet, I do notice that I think more clearly, I have more energy, and my muscles are more defined ;-).
      <br/>
      I hope you enjoy using this site and I hope you keep it alive by participating. If you have any suggestions on how I can make it better, please leave me a comment.
