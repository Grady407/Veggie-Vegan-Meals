      I created this site in an effort to facilitate healthy eating. 
      I've experienced many health benefits from eating healthy. Some of which includes a promotion at work, multiplie likes on instagram, and I've even started jogging again.
      <br/>
      But honestly, even though I'm not consistent with my healty diet, I do notice that I think more clearly, I have more energy, and my muscles are more defined ;-).
      <br/>
      Try it for yourself and I guarantee that you will notice a difference.
